# SWAPI

A REST API developed to store Star Wars planets information.

This API performs regular HTTP operations, like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. The GET endpoint can be used to query the database searching by name and/or id.

Planet information stored includes name, terrain and climate.

The API also returns the number of appearances in films for each planet. This information is calculated by calling the [swapi, the public Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/).
